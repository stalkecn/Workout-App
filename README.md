People want to be able to quickly input their personal preferences, press a button, and just go to town on a workout customized to them. 

In a world where everyone is on the go and has little extra time our app creates workouts for where ever you can fit in time to work out; at home, at the gym, or even outside. This app is the “easy button” for your workout needs, but don’t let that fool you it will kick your butt into shape. 

XXX isn’t just for those who are looking for a quick and convenient workout. It’s for those who have been working out for years and who need to be able to switch things up. We all get stuck sometimes in a workout rut, reach a plateau that we can’t seem to pass, and that’s when XXX can come in and save you from workout boredom and flabbiness. Get out of your routine and into a new and exciting workout circuit that will keep you in working condition.

Scenarios

The Beginner:
    Shirley is going to Cancun for spring break and decided to start whipping her body into shape. The trouble is she doesn’t know where to start, and she feels that gyms are intimidating. She downloaded XXX because she heard that it was a great starter tool but also completely customizable. As she progressed through the workouts over time, she was able to intensify her sessions and add weight training. By the time spring break came around, she was a workout pro and was ready to tackle the beach in her new, smaller bikinis. 

The Pro:
	Tyler has been working out for years.. and it showed. He got complimented on his arms and chest all the time! However it wasn’t until his friend made fun of him for his chicken legs that he realized he had been continuously skipping leg day. He went straight home and downloaded XXX to get some ideas on how to increase the muscle in his legs. He quickly found that he could customize his workouts to focus exclusively on his legs – just what he needed! Now his bros don’t make fun of him and the ladies appreciate a well rounded, toned bod. 

The “want something new”:
	Bianca works out everyday. The morning run, afternoon yoga, and the sit-up/push-up combo before she goes to bed. Everyday. She woke up on Tuesday and decided she wanted something different because her routine was starting to get boring. She downloaded XXX because she could select a completely randomized workout based on her decided parameters. Now she wakes up everyday, grabs her smart phone, and has a routine that never gets boring. 
	
The “To Broke for a Trainer”:
	David loves to work out but he feels like there’s more that he could be doing at his sessions. He thought about hiring a trainer to meet with but it doesn’t fit into his budget since his wallet has been feeling pretty thin here lately. He asked his friends for some options and he found out about XXX that generates workouts based on what you want. The best part about it, it’s free! Now David can continue getting an awesome work out at no cost.

The convenient: 
	Mary is constantly running around. Between the three kids, husband, home and work, she barely has any time to her self let alone time to work out. After the kids are put to bed and she has time to wind down, she feels it is inconvenient to drive to the gym for a workout. Therefore she downloaded XXX and is able to customize simple workouts she can do right on the living room floor. No leaving the kids. No leaving the house. Just simple workouts that keep her in shape enough to keep up with her busy schedule.
